# The Republic — Roadmap

A civic AI framework to challenge institutional power through structured,
legible information. Three-layer architecture (approved Apr 2026):

- **Investigation Engine** — ingest documents, classify, detect contradictions
- **Lens** — render findings against stated positions and constituency preferences
- **Campaign** — action surface (letters, calls, next-vote pressure points)

This is Lee's primary mission project, not a side project. Pinned in the
sidebar so it always surfaces regardless of activity cadence.

## Major work areas

- **Governance phases** (Phase 1a–1h, Phase 2a–2f) — forum, peer review,
  credentials, moderation, jurisdictions, ActivityPub federation, archive
- **Vote tracker** (planned, not yet active) — legislator accountability via
  voting records. See `~/.claude/projects/-home-leesalo-marvin/memory/project_republic_vote_tracker.md`
  for the architecture mapping and prior-art landscape.
- **Philosophical body** — 4 papers (~25,500 words) at
  `content/reference/the-republic/`
